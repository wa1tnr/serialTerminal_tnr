cc (no alt) is no good on mecrisp target (0x0a line-endings).

  cc-alt-0d: good on mecrisp (wondering why tho)
  cc-alt-0a: good on mecrisp (expected, and is, working).

experiment-cc.html is no good on stock arduino (ainsu).

  cc-alt-0a: good on ainsu (0x0d, 0x0a line-endings - both - confirmed in gtkterm)
  cc-alt-0d: good on ainsu as well (0x0d, 0x0a line-endings)


due: cp2104 a6/a7 test:

   0a - works but double-spaced 4800 bps Due CP2104 a6/a7

   0d - works but double-spaced 4800 bps Due CP2104 a6/a7

variants 0d and 0a are looking suspiciously similar. ;)

git mv experiment-cc.html  experiment-cc-alternate-0d+0a.html

The Due does 0x0d and 0x0a (both) so the basefile is now renamed for that situation.



END.
